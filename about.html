          <p>
            Impact Theory’s mission is to pull people out of the Matrix, at
            scale, by giving them an empowering mindset. We do that by creating
            the best-in-class entertainment and educational content.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are very aware of how vague that is, and I will punch myself in
            the mouth if all we succeed in doing is motivating people. That
            holds no interest for us as a team, and perhaps least of all me as
            an individual. We want to build things directly, and help others
            build things that solve what we believe to be the world’s biggest
            challenges. That’s why we’ll be running this company like an
            economic engine and not a non-profit. That is the only way for us to
            control our own destiny and not approach the world with our hand
            out. Additionally, the market gives instant and brutal feedback as
            to whether or not you’re delivering value. That forces you to get
            very specific, very fast.

            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <p>
              Having a great product and building a thriving community focused
              on a set of core values and celebrating transformation was how we
              built Quest Nutrition. It’s an undertaking we at It! know very
              well, and something we will be laser focused on. In fact,
              community building will be our number one priority in phase one.
              The main way we plan to build the community is by creating
              world-class free content that will help people become the best
              version of themselves and make clear what our ideology is. The
              main tent pole of our content ecosystem is Impact Theory the show,
              but we will have a host of other content that spins off of that
              show. Ultimately we will also have other content that is unrelated
              to Impact Theory the show, but is still ideologically connected.
              To us, it is critically important that the community be galvanized
              around a set of values, as this will be a key part of phase two.
